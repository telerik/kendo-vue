# Video Onboarding

Everyone with an active trial or commercial license has access to a [Kendo UI for Vue getting started video course](https://learn.telerik.com/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/45/kendo-ui-for-vue-with-typescript) available in [Telerik's Virtual Classroom](https://learn.telerik.com/learn).
The training course is developed to help you get started with the Kendo UI for Vue components and features. It aims to put you in the shoes of an engineer who adds new features to an existing application.

The course starts with adding basic Kendo UI for Vue components to the application and shows how to harness the power of Kendo in no time. Further, you get into more advanced components, like the Chart and the Grid, and learn how to incorporate Kendo UI for Vue components to interact with existing functionality and with each other. Finally, the course explores how to build your own theme and change it for all components at once.
