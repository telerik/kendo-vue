# Roadmap
What's next in Kendo UI for Vue

## Short-Term Goals (May 2021&mdash;September 2021)

Over the next couple of months the Kendo UI team will focus on delivering more **native UI components** for Vue.js

Specifically we will focus on bringing many of the fundamental UI components from Kendo UI to the Vue ecosystem, including:

- **The TabStrip Component**
- **The Form Component**
- **Checkbox & Checkbox Group Components**
- **RadioButton & RadioGroup Components**

Additionally, within this release cycle Kendo UI for Vue will add support for **Bootstrap 5** through the available Bootstrap theme.

As with every release we will also continue to expand available features within existing components and address bug fixes throughout this release cycle.

We remain committed to providing an unmatched UI suite for Vue. The kind that you would expect from Kendo UI.
