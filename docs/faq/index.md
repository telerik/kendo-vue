# Kendo UI for Vue FAQ

This article lists the answers to the most frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the Kendo UI for Vue suite.

## General Queries

### What is the difference between the Kendo UI for Vue Native and Kendo UI for Vue Wrapper suites?

The Kendo UI for Vue Native components are built from scratch with Vue.js and benefit from all the functionality provided by the framework. The Wrapper components are wrappers of the Kendo UI for jQuery suite. They use Kendo UI for jQuery under the hood and there could be some usage limitations in specific Vue scenarios.

### If we have to choose between the Kendo UI for Vue Native and Kendo UI for Vue Wrapper suites, which one would you recommend?  

Historically, the Kendo UI for Vue Wrapper components were presented at first. When we saw the potential, we started developing the Kendo UI for Vue Native suite. The focus of the Kendo UI for Vue team is now on the Native suite. Currently, the number of Native components is bigger than the components in the Wrapper suite. 

If you have the choice between the Native and Wrapper suite, what we recommend is the `Native` one.

### Which Vue version is supported by the Kendo UI for Vue suite? 

The Kendo UI for Vue suite works both with Vue 3 and Vue 2. 

### Which Vue version is recommended for the Kendo UI for Vue suite? 
Kendo UI for Vue supports both Vue 2 and Vue 3. If you you are now starting your project, `we recommend the usage of Vue 3`. If you have a legacy project that uses Vue 2, again you are good to continue its development but there could be some configuration specifics for some of the components.
