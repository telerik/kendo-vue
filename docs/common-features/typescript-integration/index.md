# Kendo UI for Vue TypeScript Integration Overview

## Vue and Typescript

With the release of Vue 3, TypeScript is getting more and more popular among Vue users. The main reason for this change is because now it is much easier to configure your project to use TypeScript and benefit from the functionality the language provides. 

> The Kendo UI for Vue Native components are TypeScript compatible in both the Vue 3 and Vue 2 scenarios.
