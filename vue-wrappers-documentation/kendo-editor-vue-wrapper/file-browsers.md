# File and Image Browsers

The Editor provides a file-and-image browser to upload or insert images and hyperlinks into its content area.

Both dialogs consist of **Address** and **Search** fields, a **File Browser** panel which shows the available files, a **File Upload**, **Create a New Folder**, and **Delete** options. Additionally, the user can set the file-property section with the fields that are suitable for images, such as web address, alternate text, width and height, and for hyperlinks, such as web address and title.

{% embed_file file-and-image-browser/main.js %}
{% endmeta %}
