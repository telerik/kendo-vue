# Active View and View Depth

The DatePicker enables you to define the first and last initial views as well as the last view to which the user can navigate.

To define the first view that the DatePicker initially renders, use the `start` option.

The Calendar supports the following predefined view options:
* `month`&mdash;Shows the days of the month.
* `year`&mdash;Shows the months of the year.
* `decade`&mdash;Shows the years of the decade.
* `century`&mdash;Shows the decades of the century.
