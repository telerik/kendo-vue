# Active View and View Depth

The Calendar enables you to define the [first and last initial views](#toc-active-view) as well as the [last view to which the user can navigate](#toc-view-navigation-depth).

## Active View

To define the first view that the Calendar initially renders, use the `start` option.

The Calendar supports the following predefined view options:
* `month`&mdash;Shows the days of the month.
* `year`&mdash;Shows the months of the year.
* `decade`&mdash;Shows the years of the decade.
* `century`&mdash;Shows the decades of the century.

## View Navigation Depth

You can define the last view to which the user can navigate (view navigation depth) by setting the `depth` option.
