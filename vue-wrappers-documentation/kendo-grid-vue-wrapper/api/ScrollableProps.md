# ScrollableProps

### scrollable-virtual `Boolean`

If `scrollable-virtual` is set to `true`, the Grid will always display a single page of data. Scrolling changes only the data which is currently displayed.

### scrollable-endless `Boolean`

If `scrollable-endless` is set to `true`, the Grid will always display a single page of data. Scrolling to the end will gradually load more items until all items are displayed.
