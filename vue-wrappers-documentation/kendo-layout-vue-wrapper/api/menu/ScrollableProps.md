# ScrollableProps

### scrollable-distance `Number`

Sets the scroll amount (in pixels) that the Menu applies when the user hovers over the scroll buttons. Each such distance is animated and then another animation starts with the same distance. If the user clicks a scroll button, the Menu scrolls with a doubled distance.
