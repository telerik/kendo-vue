# Built-in Layouts

The layout of the Diagram is based on the automatic organization of data and on the way its shapes connect (incidence structure).

The `layout()` method serves as the gateway to various layout algorithms. For detailed information on the layout types and options, refer to the [layout API reference of the Diagram](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/dataviz/ui/diagram/configuration/layout).
