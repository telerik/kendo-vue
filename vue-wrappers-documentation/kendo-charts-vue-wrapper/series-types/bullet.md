# Bullet

Bullet charts are categorical charts which are a variation of the Bar charts.

You can use them as a replacement for dashboard gauges and meters. The bullet graph compares a given quantitative measure, such as temperature, against a qualitative range, such as warm, hot, and cold, and a symbol marker which encodes the comparative measure, such as the max temperature a year ago.

## Basic Usage

The following example demonstrates the Bullet chart in action.

{% meta height:460 %}
{% embed_file series-types/bullet/main.vue preview %}
{% embed_file series-types/bullet/main.js %}
{% endmeta %}
