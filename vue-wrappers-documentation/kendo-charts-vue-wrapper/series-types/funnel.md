# Funnel

Funnel charts are freeform charts which display a single series of data in progressively decreasing or increasing proportions.

These proportions are organized in segments and each segment represents the value for the particular item from the series.

## Basic Usage

The following example demonstrates the Funnel chart in action.

{% meta height:460 %}
{% embed_file series-types/funnel/basic-usage/main.vue preview %}
{% embed_file series-types/funnel/basic-usage/main.js %}
{% endmeta %}

## Funnel Labels

The labels of the Funnel chart are highly configurable. You can specify their properties for visibility, position and alignment, font color, size and so on through the `series-defaults-labels` prop.

{% meta height:620 %}
{% embed_file series-types/funnel/labels/main.vue preview %}
{% embed_file series-types/funnel/labels/main.js %}
{% endmeta %}
