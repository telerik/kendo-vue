## Solution description
To achieve the following scenario, we use the [onRowClick]({% slug api_grid_gridprops %}#toc-onrowclick) event of the Native Grid and the following code:
```
onRowClick(event) {
    if (event.event.metaKey || event.event.ctrlKey || event.event.shiftKey) {
    event.dataItem[this.selectedField] =
        !event.dataItem[this.selectedField];
    }
}
```

### Runnable example

To test the following example press `Ctrl`, `Shift` or `Command(for Mac)` buttons and click on selected Grid row.

{% meta id:index height:600 %}
{% embed_file grid-select-row-when-shift-ctrl-command-are-pressed/main.vue preview %}
{% embed_file grid-select-row-when-shift-ctrl-command-are-pressed/main.js %}
{% endmeta %}
