## Environment

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>

## Description

I want to visualise a spinner icon once the Form has been submitted.

## Solution

This can be achieved by using the iconClass props and conditionally changing the className to that of a spinner or loader based on the disabled variable.

### Runnable example

{% meta id:index height:500 %}
{% embed_file spinner-inside-submit-button/main.vue preview %}
{% embed_file spinner-inside-submit-button/FormContent.vue %}
{% embed_file spinner-inside-submit-button/FormInput.vue %}
{% embed_file spinner-inside-submit-button/main.js %}
{% endmeta %}
