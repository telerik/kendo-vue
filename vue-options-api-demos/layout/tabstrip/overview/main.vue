                    Tallinn is the capital and largest city of Estonia. It is situated on
                    the northern coast of the country, on the shore of the Gulf of
                    Finland, 80 km (50 mi) south of Helsinki, east of Stockholm and west
                    of Saint Petersburg. From the 13th century until 1918 (and briefly
                    during the Nazi occupation of Estonia from 1941 to 1944), the city was
                    known as Reval. Tallinn occupies an area of 159.2 km2 (61.5 sq mi) and
                    has a population of 443,894. Approximately 32% of Estonia's total
                    population lives in Tallinn.
                </p>

                    Tallinn was founded in 1248, but the earliest human settlements are
                    over 5,000 years old, making it one of the oldest capital cities of
                    Northern Europe. Due to its strategic location, the city became a
                    major trade hub, especially from the 14th to the 16th century, when it
                    grew in importance as part of the Hanseatic League.
